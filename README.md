# World_Weather_Analysis
This repository was created to capture the three deliverables for the Module 6 challenge. The various code and outputs were focused on using the citypy module and APIs (OpenWeatherMap and gmaps) to:
- Generated a random data frame of latitude and longitude and nearest city,
- Find the weather data for the nearest city 
- Filter the data frame to only include locations that input user criteria for maximum temperature range
- Find the name of the nearest hotel using the Google Places API
- Generate Google Maps with markers and layers accordingly.
